# Sunrise Scramble

### About
Sunrise Scramble is a text-based RPG. Originally a class project, I've continued tweaking and refining the game. I have high aspirations.

You play as a farmer who must complete their chores and make breakfast. To do so, you must navigate around the farmstead and pick up and place items.

### Upcoming Developments
1. **COLOR!** I will implement ANSI color codes to write colorful text in the terminal.

3. **FLESHED OUT CHARACTERS!** NPCs will have more than just one line of dialogue. They will have tiny side quests and provide hints.

4. **BIGGER MAP!** New areas to explore, on and off the farm.

5. **AN ACTUAL MAP!** I will design a map of the farmstead, either as an image that can be opened on the player's computer or drawn out in the terminal. Probably the former.

6. **PLAYER CUSTOMIZATION!** Rather than never mentioning the name of the player character, I will let the player decide their name, the name of their farm, and their pronouns - and possibly a few physical characteristics.

7. **POKER!** You will be able to play Texas Hold 'Em in the game. Don't ask me how yet.

### Download Instructions
1. Navigate to the game's .zip [file](SunriseScramble.zip) here on GitHub

2. Select the "Download raw file" button (if that doesn't work, click the "View raw" link and it should automatically download)

3. Once you've downloaded the .zip file, navigate to it in your computer's file system

4. Extract all the files

5. Find the folder named dist and run game.exe (NOT game.py!). It should open in the terminal.

6. Have fun! If you get stuck or have any problems, open an issue in this repo.
